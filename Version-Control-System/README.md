1. **Getting Started** - Installation, configuration, and understanding version control fundamentals
2. **Basic Workflow** - Your daily Git commands for tracking and committing changes
3. **Branching and Merging** - Working with multiple lines of development simultaneously
4. **Working with Remote Repositories** - Collaborating with others using GitHub, GitLab, or similar platforms
5. **Viewing History** - Understanding your project's evolution and navigating past changes
6. **Undoing Changes** - Recovering from mistakes and managing your commit history
7. **Collaboration Workflows** - Team practices, pull requests, and code review processes
8. **Advanced Topics** - Power user techniques for complex scenarios
